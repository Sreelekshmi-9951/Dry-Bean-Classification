# Dry-Bean-Classification
Capstone Project based on Dry Bean Classification using Machine Learning 
The Dry Bean Classification project explores the application of machine learning techniques to classify different types of dry beans based on various shape and texture features. Using the Dry Bean Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we compare multiple classification algorithms to determine the most effective model.

Our study involves comprehensive data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation. We also investigate the impact of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on model performance. The results show that the Random Forest classifier achieves the highest accuracy of 99.93%, both with and without PCA, making it the most suitable model for this classification task.

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in agricultural and food quality control applications, where accurate classification of grains and beans is crucial for sorting, pricing, and quality assurance.
